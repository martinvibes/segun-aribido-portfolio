            I work on digital products that improve everyday experiences, from
            apps and dashboards to design systems. Whether it’s a nonprofit tool
            or a startup MVP, I focus on clarity, usability, and craft.

          <p className="text-[#505050] text-[24px] font-normal font-helvetica400">
            I like to begin every project with curiosity and empathy. We’ll
            start by uncovering the story behind your product, who it serves,
            why it matters, and what success looks like. From there, I translate
            insights into clear design goals, prototypes, and a roadmap that
            aligns your mission with measurable outcomes. Collaboration is key;
            we build together, not in silos.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-[#505050] text-[24px] font-normal font-helvetica400">
            Yes, I combine UX thinking with UI craft to design experiences that
            feel both intuitive and meaningful. I start by understanding the
            people behind the product, their goals, challenges, and motivations,
            and then translate those insights into interfaces that are simple,
            accessible, and beautiful to use.

            How do I work with startups and scale-ups?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[#505050] text-[24px] font-normal font-helvetica400">
            I thrive in fast-moving environments. With startups, I help bring
            clarity to big ideas, shaping MVPs, simplifying user journeys, and
            building a visual identity that feels ready for market. For
            scale-ups, I focus on optimization: tightening design systems,
            improving workflows, and helping teams ship faster without losing
            quality.

          <p className="text-[#505050] text-[24px] font-normal font-helvetica400">
            Definitely. I’ve worked on large-scale digital products used across
            organizations, from admin dashboards and reporting tools to
            field-level mobile apps. I focus on creating systems that improve
            efficiency, reduce cognitive load, and make complex workflows feel
            effortless. Enterprise design isn’t just about functionality, it’s
            about clarity, speed, and trust.

            How do I partner with developers in delivery?

          <p className="text-[#505050] text-[24px] font-normal font-helvetica400">
            I treat developers as design partners. I share prototypes early,
            discuss technical constraints, and document everything from
            components to motion specs. I’m comfortable working with Figma
            variables, design systems, and tools like Storybook or Zeplin to
            keep implementation seamless. Good communication and shared
            ownership make delivery faster and cleaner.

            Yes, I’m open to freelance and contract projects. I love joining
            teams that need hands-on design help, whether that’s refining a
            product, building a design system, or bringing an idea to life from
            scratch. If it’s meaningful work with good people, I’m interested.

          <p className="text-[#505050] text-[24px] font-normal font-helvetica400">
            I see AI as a creative partner, not a replacement. My approach is to
            use AI tools to accelerate exploration, generating variations,
            testing ideas, and refining content faster, while keeping the core
            of design human-led. I use AI to handle repetitive tasks and uncover
            insights, freeing more time for strategy, storytelling, and
            meaningful user experiences.
